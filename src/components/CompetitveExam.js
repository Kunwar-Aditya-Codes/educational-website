            that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various
            undergraduate subjects in engineering and science for admission into
            the Masters Program and Recruitment by some Public Sector Companies.
            It comprises 29 disciplines or subjects as of 2022 and candidates
            can go for any depending on their niche and desire. The majority of
            students are aiming to crack the GATE exam because it will not only
            intensify their career growth but also make their future bright and
            secure.

            JEE
          </h2>
          <p className="p-2">
            The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is an engineering entrance
            assessment conducted for admission to various engineering colleges
            in India. It is constituted by two different examinations: the JEE
            Main and the JEE Advanced. The Joint Seat Allocation Authority
            (JoSAA) conducts the joint admission process for a total of 23
            Indian Institute of Technology campuses, 31 National Institute of
            Technology campuses, 25 Indian Institute of Information Technology
            campuses and 19 other Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs)
            based on the rank obtained by a student in JEE Main and JEE
            Advanced. There are some institutes, such as the Indian Institutes
            of Science Education and Research (IISERs), the Indian Institute of
            Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum
            Technology (RGIPT), the Indian Institute of Space Science and
            Technology (IIST), and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), which
            use the score obtained in the JEE Advanced examination as the basis
            for admission.These institutes do not participate in the
            post-examination counselling session (JoSAA). Any student who takes
            admission to an Indian Institute of Technology cannot appear for the
            JEE Advanced examination again, but the same is not the case with
            NIT, IISc, IISERs, RGIPT, IIPE, and IIST since they have separate
            and exclusive counselling sessions.
